// Answer the following questions:

// Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)

I added steer_pid_data__until16s.png and throttle_pid_data__until16s.png.
First, my car avoided a collision with the first car.
Second, my car sometimes avoided a collision with the first car.
After that, my car can't go straight

In figure "steer_pid_data__until16s",
The steering output had been changed to cancel Error Steering.

In figure "throttle_pid_data__until16s.png",
The steering output has been changed to cancel Error Throttle.

// What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?
PID affects on the amount of the next time control parameters.
P values is calculated from current error only. 
Therefore, it has the most impact on the output.
D values is calculated from difference between current and past error.
It suppresses sudden changes in output and oscillation. It smooth the plot.
I values is calculated from cumulative error.
When PD control converges to a value (bias value) other than 0,
the effect of that bias value is removed by adding I control.


// How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?
I use twiggle algorism.
And I make a script that can run the simulator repeatedly and extract the optimal parameters with the twiggle algorithm.


// PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?
pros: 
  A versatile control method that can be used with various models.
cons:
  Complex control depending on the particular model is not possible.

// (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?
